# Course-6-Project---Scribbler
Front-end of a blogging website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This submission covers all three sections of the assignment. 

Part A: Creating Home Page

Part B: Creating PostsList Page.

Part C: Creating Post Page.

Note:
An attempt has been made to mirror the results of the problem statement as much as possible. However, there are minor differences in the appearance of the pages and their contituent elements. 

In Part B, static post entries have been moved from postslist.html to postslist.js. Each post is pushed into an array and rendered in the form of an HTML. When a post is deleted, the list is re-rendered.
